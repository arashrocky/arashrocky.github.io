You have been invited to participate in a research project carried out by researchers at University College London, in collaboration with Universitas Tadulako and Universitas Indonesia. We are conducting a study that aims to understand the experiences of household relocation after a disaster.

This study has been approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee (Project ID: 28305-001) and the Research Ethics Committee on Social Studies and Humanities in Indonesia (Application Number: 3082024000001).

We guarantee that any information you submit will be kept confidential. Your name or any information that might identify you in the study report will not be used. Your participation is completely voluntary. You have the right to withdraw at any time or to refuse to answer some of the questions. Thank you.

## Project purpose

In disasters, households often leave their habitual residence due to safety concerns or evacuation orders. These households may temporarily seek shelter in a variety of places, such as with family and friends or in emergency camps. However, as time goes on, some households may be unable or unwilling to return to their previous residence. In these situations, they may need to continue to relocate as they search for or await permanent housing. 

![Example depiction of different post-disaster relocation pathways taken by households](info/central-sulawesi/household_relocation.png "Example depiction of different post-disaster relocation pathways taken by households")

Protracted displacement is associated with significant hardships for households, such as loss of livelihood, the disruption of education, psychosocial issues, and worsened housing conditions. In this study, we seek to understand the factors that drove different relocation outcomes and the consequences of those relocation outcomes on household recovery and wellbeing.

To understand household experiences, we have designed a survey that asks questions about different time periods before and after the 2018 earthquake and tsunami:
* The weeks just before the earthquake and tsunami (September 2018)
* The week just after the earthquake and tsunami (29 September to 6 October 2018)
* The transition period for each relocation you made
* Today

## Frequently asked questions

<details>
<summary>Why have I been chosen?</summary>
  In this study, we survey respondents based on their place of residence in the area affected by the 2018 Central Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami. You are selected as one of the respondents in this study randomly based on that criterion.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I have to participate?</summary>
  Participation is voluntary -- you decide whether or not to take part. If you decide to participate, you will be asked to consent at the start of the questionnaire. Even if you provide consent, you are able to withdraw at any time during the survey. If you decide to withdraw, we will ask you what you wish to happen to the data provided thus far.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What will happen if I participate?</summary>
  This survey will take approximately 20 minutes. We guarantee that any information you provide will be kept anonymous. Your name or any information that could identify you in the study will not be used. Your participation is completely voluntary. You have the right to stop participating at any time, or refuse to answer any questions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of participating?</summary>
  We acknowledge the potential risk of trauma-triggering effects, particularly if you have experienced the negative impacts of past disasters. Discussing sensitive topics or recalling distressing memories related to disasters may potentially evoke emotional distress. To manage this risk, we have designed the survey in a sensitive and considerate manner. You can also opt out or skip specific questions that you find distressing. Additionally, you can withdraw from participating at any time without giving a reason.
