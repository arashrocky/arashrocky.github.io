As a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Vision, I am currently developing autonomous driving systems (ADS) under the guidance of [**Professor Jonathan Wu**](https://www.uwindsor.ca/engineering/electrical/317/dr-jonathan-wu). My work combines advanced research with a passion for solving real-world challenges. I bring a strong foundation in computer vision engineering from my previous role as an Industrial Automation Engineer, where I gained hands-on experience in practical applications. I completed my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees under the supervision of Professor [**Karim Ansari-Asl**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=xlbTBDEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

<!-- I'm currently researching household displacement due to disasters at University College London (UCL). My background is in structural engineering and I have over nine years of experience quantifying disaster risks. At the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation, I conducted earthquake risk assessment at the national and regional scales. At Arup, I was focused on the campus and building-specific scales, with an emphasis on modeling recovery after disasters. -->
