I'm currently researching household displacement due to disasters at University College London (UCL). My research is supervised by Prof. Carmine Galasso (UCL) and Prof. Jack Baker (Stanford University).

My background is in structural engineering and I have over nine years of experience quantifying disaster risks. At the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation, I focused on national and regional scale earthquake risk assessment. At Arup, I worked at the building-specfic and campus scales, with an emphasis on recovery modeling.
