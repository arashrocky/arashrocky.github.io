abstract: 'In recent decades, hundreds of studies have covered seismic vulnerability assessment and the derivation of fragility models. However, these studies primarily focus on structural damage and the associated repair costs. Assessing fatalities requires an evaluation of the proportion of damaged buildings that suffer partial or total collapse, as well as the expected fatality rates for occupants inside those collapsed buildings. To support these modeling needs, we reviewed past studies on casualties, existing proposals for collapse and fatality rates, and detailed damage databases that characterize different collapse mechanisms. Based on this review, collapse and fatality rates are proposed relative to a baseline building class. These rates are further calibrated considering reported fatalities since 1950 and the average annual fatalities estimated by the Global Seismic Risk Model of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation. Results show that the probability of collapse tends to decrease with the number of stories, while fatality rates have the opposite trend. Furthermore, an open-access database of calibrated collapse and fatality rates is provided and can be used to assess fatalities due to earthquake scenarios or in probabilistic seismic risk analysis.'
