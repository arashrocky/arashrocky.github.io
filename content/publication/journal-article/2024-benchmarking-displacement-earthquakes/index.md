abstract: 'In the aftermath of an earthquake, the number of residents whose housing was destroyed is often used to approximate the number of people displaced (i.e., rendered homeless) after the event. While this metric can provide rapid situational awareness regarding potential long-term housing needs, more recent research highlights the importance of additional factors beyond housing damage within the scope of household displacement and return (e.g., utility disruption, tenure, place attachment). This study benchmarks population displacement estimates using this simplified conventional approach (i.e., only considering housing destruction) through three scenario models for recent earthquakes in Haiti, Japan, and Nepal. These model predictions are compared with officially reported values and alternate mobile location data-based estimates from the literature. The results highlight the promise of scenario models to realistically estimate population displacement and potential long-term housing needs after earthquakes, but also highlight a large range of uncertainty in the predicted values. Furthermore, purely basing displacement estimates on housing damage offers no view on how the displaced population counts vary with time as compared to more comprehensive models that include other factors influencing population return or alternative approaches, such as using mobile location data.'
